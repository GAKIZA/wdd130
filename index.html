            <p>My name is Samuel Imananiyogakiza, I am from Rwanda, Kigali. I am eager to know web development as it is my passion. Basically, I am an aircraft Engineer type rated on B737NG and DHC-8-402 Aircraft. I am ICAO certified airworthiness State Safety Inspector and also have extensive knowledge and skills in aircraft accident investigation. I have participated to some investigation of serious incident. Besides, I am Electrical and electronics Engineer graduate from former National University of Rwanda. I am thrilled to learning new skills. In social life, I am a christian and I will remain christian because Jesus Christ, my Lord and Savior paid high price on cross so as I could be associated to my Creator. The last is the basis of my joy while on the earth and everlastingly. I am a proud passionate in programming and I really love to code, the reason I amlearning them. Would like to be like me?
